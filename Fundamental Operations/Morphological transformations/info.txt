Morphological Operations

-->A set of operations that process images based on shapes.
   Morphological operations apply a structuring element to an input image and generate an output image.

The most basic morphological operations are: Erosion and Dilation. They have a wide array of uses, i.e. :
    - Removing noise
    - Isolation of individual elements and joining disparate elements in an image.
    - Finding of intensity bumps or holes in an image


The dilatation : dst(x,y)=max(x′,y′):element(x′,y′)≠0 and src(x+x′,y+y′)

The erosion : dst(x,y)=min(x′,y′):element(x′,y′)≠0 and src(x+x′,y+y′)
